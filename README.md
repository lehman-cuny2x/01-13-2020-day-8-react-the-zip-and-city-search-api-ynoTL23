# City - Zip Code Search API

A React app is created to send GET requests to an API to retrieve information regarding a certain city or zip code. The data is returned as JSON, parse and stylized for the user.

The app features two distinct methods of searching: by zip code and city name.

The client/user is initially greeted with a static page and two buttons. When clicked, the user will be taken to the respective methods of search.
